# Changelog

## [0.1.0]

### Added

- Establish the controlled IC platform boundary with no default capabilities.
- Adopt Testkit's caller-bounded Candid decoding, preserving exact-result and
  argument-list policies, compact diagnostics and typed causes.
- Expose DTO derives and encoding through an explicit external-contract surface.
- Expose the shared CDK executor independently of Candid. No full CDK runtime,
  host parser or consumer migration is included in this initial local candidate.
